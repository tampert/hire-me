# Organised chaos
**My name** is Dirk Soentjens. I am a designer living in Wessem, the Netherlands. I like coding, music, and solving problems.

**I have** a bachelors degree of Art and Technology from The Hogeschool voor de kunsten Utrecht (HKU) (http://www.hku.nl).

**Currently I** work as a designer, but I am always looking for an interesting opportunity to make better use of my skills related to coding and gsolving problems.

**Given the** right opportunity I am willing to move pretty much anywhere.
